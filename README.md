# healthcare-data-science

This repository contains a curated set of applied healthcare data science projects spanning clinical analytics, public health modeling, and various AI/ML techniques..  
Each subfolder is a **standalone project** with its own README and documentation.  
Collectively, these projects demonstrate experience working with real-world healthcare data constraints, decision-support pipelines, and analytical methods used in industry and research settings.

## Project Index

### Core Projects

- **`organic-amr-rl/`**  
  Reinforcement learning–based simulation framework for exploring antimicrobial resistance dynamics under organic compound exposure, generating experimental results, figures, and tables for a microbiology methods study.

- **`glp1-nlp-demo/`**  
  End-to-end NLP pipeline for abstracting structured labels from unstructured clinical notes, demonstrated using synthetic GLP-1 medication data.

- **`rf_asthma_lab/`**  
  Machine learning analysis of asthma risk and outcomes developed for an *MDPI Laboratories* submission, including feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretability.

- **`amr/`**  
  Modeling antimicrobial resistance dynamics using simulated datasets, with emphasis on temporal trends, intervention pressure, and system-level behavior.

- **`epidemiological_quarantine_algorithm/`**  
  Quarantine triage and intake modeling system combining rule-based logic and machine learning, developed during emergency public health response work.

- **`automated-epidemiological-report/`**  
  Automated generation of epidemiological surveillance reports and summary metrics for rapid situational awareness.

- **`smoking-cessation-model/`**  
  Predictive modeling framework to identify individuals most likely to benefit from smoking cessation interventions using synthetic cohort data.

- **`diabetes-intervention/`**  
  Scenario-based simulation of a hypothetical diabetes intervention, including population impact and high-level cost modeling.

### Exploratory Projects

- **`oral-cancer-spss-analysis/`**  
  Legacy statistical analysis of oral cancer trial data using SPSS, retained for completeness.

- **`sql-cms-medicare/`**  
  Exploratory SQL analyses of CMS Medicare datasets focused on utilization and chronic condition prevalence.
