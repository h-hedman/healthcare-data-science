# public-health-models

This repository archives a range of modeling and analytics projects focused on public health outcomes. These examples span R, Python, and SQL, and demonstrate reproducible workflows, statistical modeling, and domain-informed reasoning rooted in epidemiology. While originally developed for roles in real-world evidence (RWE) and public sector analytics, they reflect a broad base of data science skills applicable across industries.

### Contents

- **`oral-cancer-spss-analysis/`**  
  Legacy statistical reporting using SPSS-format `.sav` data. Includes exploratory analysis and t-tests comparing treatment and placebo groups in a clinical dataset.

- **`sql-cms-medicare/`**  
  Sample SQL queries and exploratory summaries using publicly available CMS Medicare data.

- **`automated-epidemiological-report/`**  
  Surveillance and reporting pipeline developed during national emergency responses at CDC. Includes automated scripting for outbreak metrics and time series summaries.

- **`amr/`**  
  Infectious disease modeling using simulated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data. Demonstrates predictive modeling, spatial mapping, and exploratory analysis of resistance patterns.

These projects reflect my earlier work in applied epidemiology and emergency public health analytics. For current generalist and product-oriented data science work, see my pinned repos.
