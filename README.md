# healthcare-data-science

This repository contains a collection of applied health data science projects focused on public health outcomes, surveillance systems, and intervention modeling. Each folder represents a standalone project with its own documentation. Collectively, these projects demonstrate real-world experience in epidemiology, health analytics, and decision support systems developed across academic, public health, and research settings.

## Project Overviews

- **`sql-cms-medicare/`**  
  Descriptive SQL analyses of CMS Medicare data focused on chronic condition prevalence and healthcare utilization.

- **`diabetes-intervention/`**  
  Simulation of a hypothetical intervention targeting diabetes outcomes, including scenario modeling and cost estimates for at-risk populations.

- **`smoking-cessation-model/`**  
  Predictive model for identifying individuals most likely to benefit from smoking cessation programs, using synthetic patient data and risk profiling.

- **`epidemiological_quarantine_algorithm/`**  
  A quarantine triage engine developed during emergency response work at CDC. Combines rule-based logic and machine learning to simulate real-time public health intake decisions.

- **`automated-epidemiological-report/`**  
  Automated generation of outbreak reports and surveillance metrics designed for field deployment during national emergencies.

- **`amr/`**  
  Analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dynamics using simulated datasets. Includes resistance trend modeling, spatial mapping, and risk factor analysis.

- **`oral-cancer-spss-analysis/`**  
  Statistical comparison of treatment effects in oral cancer clinical trial data. Includes legacy SPSS `.sav` analysis and outcome interpretation.
