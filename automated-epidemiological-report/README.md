# Automated Epidemiological Report: Tool for Epidemiological Surveillance

* **Purpose** 
  - An automated epidemiological reporting script with PDF output for settings with limited or no internet access
 
* **Overview** 
  - Processes descriptive statistics and epidemiological trends with figure and table output
  - This script is most useful for broad overview of epidemiological trends and functions as an excellent resource in settings without internet 

* **Example Usage**: provide epidemiological metrics of patient outbreaks within a resource-limited setting 

* **Background**
  - I developed the first version of this code while working for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during a nation-wide response. Although originally developed as an urgent need, the script served as a pilot for enhancing epidemiological surveillance for the entire national response.
