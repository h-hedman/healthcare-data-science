# Epidemiological Analyses of Antimicrobial Resistance

## Purpose

This project uses statistical models to study antimicrobial resistance (AMR) transmission between humans and animals in rural settings.

## Overview

The analyses focus on fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of AMR in rural Ecuador, integrating mixed effects modeling and geospatial methods to evaluate environmental exposure and risk factors associated with small-scale poultry farming.
