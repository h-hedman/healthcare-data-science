# SQL Queries and Descriptive Analysis Using CMS Medicare Data

## Purpose

This project demonstrates foundational SQL skills applied to synthetic Medicare claims data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It showcases basic data querying, filtering, and aggregation techniques relevant to healthcare analytics and Real-World Evidence (RWE) workflows.

## Overview

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a core tool for storing, retrieving, and analyzing data in relational databases. In public health and medical research, SQL is widely used for preparing analytic cohorts, summarizing condition prevalence, and generating descriptive statistics from large-scale administrative datasets. This project integrates SQL with R and SQLite to simulate typical data wrangling tasks in health services research.
